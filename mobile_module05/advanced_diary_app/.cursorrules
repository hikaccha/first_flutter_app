# Flutter Development Rules for Cursor IDE

## Project Structure

- This is a Flutter project with Android and iOS native directories
- Main Dart code is in lib/
- Android-specific code is in android/
- Configuration files: pubspec.yaml, android/build.gradle.kts

## File Extensions to Recognize

- .dart files are Dart language files
- .kts files are Kotlin script files for Gradle
- .gradle files are Gradle build files
- .json files in android/app/ are configuration files

## Flutter Commands

When suggesting Flutter commands, always use:

- flutter clean && flutter pub get for dependency issues
- flutter run -d <device> for running on specific devices
- flutter doctor for diagnosing environment issues

## Android Development

- android/ folder contains native Android project
- Key files: android/app/build.gradle.kts, android/build.gradle.kts
- SHA-1 fingerprints are crucial for Firebase/Google services
- Use ./gradlew from android/ directory for Gradle commands

## Firebase Configuration

- google-services.json is critical for Android Firebase setup
- Package name must match between Dart code and Firebase project
- SHA-1 fingerprints must be registered in Firebase Console

## Error Handling

- Red folder indicators often mean IDE cache issues
- Use flutter clean && gradle clean for build issues
- Check flutter doctor for environment problems
